                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <P>
                    Ever since l was young l have loved travelling. Most of the time we would travel as a family. We had yearly trips which included the extended family. One thing with travelling is that it opens up your mind to new experience. As an adult l have travelled around the country with my close friends. I have never travelled solo but l look forward to that experience. That also includes international trips. So in this travel vlog l will show case some of my favourite trips and also give you tips on how to travel on a budget. There would also be a section where I would show you some of the places l would like to travel to. I hope you enoy the vlog.
